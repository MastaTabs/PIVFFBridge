# PIV FFBridge

Bought a snapped off PicassoIV and don't want to use cables to attach the video slot connector?
Then PIV FFBridge comes to the rescue.
It also integrates the functionality of the CD-Mix that not many people know it exists.
This way, you can listen to CD and Amiga audio through the PIV audio output at the same time.

The design is proven and working good. It was created from the original schematics and PCB layout.
